Now let's unlock the full power of agent tools by building custom logic, delegating to specialist agents, and handling real-world complexities.","metadata":{"id":"tiWhZUNveBNW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 🤔 Why do Agents need Tools?\n\n**The Problem**\n\nWithout tools, the agent's knowledge is frozen in time — it can't access today's news or your company's inventory. It has no connection to the outside world, so the agent can't take actions for you.\n\n**The Solution:** Tools are what transform your isolated LLM into a capable agent that can actually help you get things done.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Turn your Python functions into Agent tools\n- ✅ Build an Agent and use it **as a tool** in another agent\n- ✅ **Build your first multi-tool agent**\n- ✅ Explore the different tool types in ADK","metadata":{"id":"g-rxFWtXeBNW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## ‼️ Please Read\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.

Dictionary Returns**: Tools return `{\"status\": \"success\", \"data\": ...}` or `{\"status\": \"error\", \"error_message\": ...}`  \n**2. Clear Docstrings**: LLMs use docstrings to understand when and how to use tools  \n**3. Type Hints**: Enable ADK to generate proper schemas (`str`, `dict`, etc.)  \n**4. Error Handling**: Structured error responses help LLMs handle failures gracefully  \n\nThese patterns make your tools reliable and easy for LLMs to use correctly.\n\n👉 Let's see this in action with our first tool:","metadata":{"id":"KEyRX5lJeBNY"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Pay attention to the docstring, type hints, and return value.\ndef get_fee_for_payment_method(method: str) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"Looks up the transaction fee percentage for a given payment method.\n\n    This tool simulates looking up a company's internal fee structure based on\n    the name of the payment method provided by the user.\n\n    Args:\n        method: The name of the payment method.
