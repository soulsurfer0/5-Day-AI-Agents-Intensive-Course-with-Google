# 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google 2025

Welcome! This repository contains my personal notes, code, and solutions for the **5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course** hosted by Google X and Kaggle.

This 5-day online program, crafted by Google's ML researchers and engineers, helps developers explore the foundations and practical applications of AI agents.

## Course Overview

The curriculum is designed to move from foundational concepts to building production-ready systems. Each day blends conceptual deep dives, hands-on codelabs, and live discussions.

**Key concepts covered**:
- Core agent components: Models, Tools, Orchestration, Memory, and Evaluation.
- Agent Ops: Reliability, governance, and security.
- Practical application: Building agents with the Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Gemini.
- Interoperability: Using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for complex, long-running operations.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Core Model**: Google Gemini
- **Framework**: Agent Development Kit (ADK)
- **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Platform**: Kaggle (for Codelabs)
