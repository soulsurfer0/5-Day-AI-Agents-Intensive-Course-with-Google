Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n\nJust like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n\n## ‼️ Please Read\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.\n\n> ⏸️ **Note:**  When you first start the notebook via running a cell you might see a banner in the notebook header that reads **\"Waiting for the next available notebook\"**. The queue should drop rapidly; however, during peak bursts you might have to wait a few minutes.\n\n> ❌ **Note:** Avoid using the **Run all** cells command as this can trigger a QPM limit resulting in 429 errors when calling the backing model. Suggested flow is to run each cell in order - one at a time. [See FAQ on 429 errors for more information.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaggle5daysofai/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs)\n\n**For help: Ask questions on the [Kaggle Discord](https://discord.com/invite/kaggle) server.**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 📖 Get started with Kaggle Notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using Kaggle Notebooks, welcome!

Verify Your Account (Required)**\n\nTo use the Kaggle Notebooks in this course, you'll need to verify your account with a phone number.\n\nYou can do this in your [Kaggle settings](https://www.kaggle.com/settings).\n\n**2. Make Your Own Copy**\n\nTo run any code in this notebook, you first need your own editable copy.\n\nClick the `Copy and Edit` button in the top-right corner.\n\n![Copy and Edit button](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/Images/5gdai_sc_1.png)\n\nThis creates a private copy of the notebook just for you.\n\n**3. Run Code Cells**\n\nOnce you have your copy, you can run code.\n\nClick the ▶️ Run button next to any code cell to execute it.\n\n![Run cell button](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/Images/5gdai_sc_2.png)\n\nRun the cells in order from top to bottom.\n\n**4.

Concluding Thought:**\n\n*   Embracing Multi-Agent Systems isn't just about adopting a new technology; it's about adopting a new mindset. By fostering collaboration, modularity, and intelligence within your software, you can build more powerful, flexible, and resilient applications that are ready for the future. It's time to let your software agents do the heavy lifting, so you can focus on innovation.\nWriterAgent > ## Unleash the Power of Collaboration: How Multi-Agent Systems Can Revolutionize Your Development Workflow\n\nTired of wrestling with monolithic codebases and the isolation of siloed development efforts? Picture this: your software components don't just coexist; they work together seamlessly, intelligently, and autonomously. This isn't a futuristic dream; it's the tangible promise of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), and it's poised to fundamentally transform how we build software.\n\nOne of the most significant advantages of MAS is **enhanced modularity and flexibility**. By breaking down intricate problems into smaller, independent agents, you gain unparalleled control. Need to update a specific feature? Simply modify the relevant agent without impacting the rest of your system. This granular approach makes your software far more adaptable to evolving requirements and dynamic environments.\n\nBeyond flexibility, MAS offers **improved scalability and resilience**. Distributing workloads across multiple agents allows your systems to scale horizontally, effortlessly handling increased demand. Crucially, the failure of a single agent doesn't have to cascade into a system-wide crash. This inherent robustness, coupled with the potential for parallel processing, leads to faster, more reliable execution.\n\nFurthermore, MAS empowers **smarter problem-solving and automation**. Imagine agents that can negotiate, collaborate, and even learn from each other to tackle complex challenges collectively. This intelligent collaboration can automate repetitive tasks and intricate decision-making, freeing up developers to focus on innovation rather than routine maintenance.\n\nFinally, MAS introduces **new paradigms for software design**. It encourages a shift away from traditional imperative programming towards more declarative and decentralized architectures. This can lead to fascinating emergent behaviors and self-organizing systems, opening doors to cutting-edge applications in AI, IoT, and distributed computing.\n\nEmbracing MAS is more than just adopting new tech; it's about a paradigm shift. By fostering collaboration, modularity, and intelligence within your software, you can build more powerful, flexible, and resilient applications ready for whatever the future holds. Let your software agents collaborate and innovate, and focus on the next big breakthrough.\nEditorAgent > ## Unleash the Power of Collaboration: How Multi-Agent Systems Can Revolutionize Your Development Workflow\n\nAre you tired of wrestling with monolithic codebases and the isolation of siloed development efforts?

The pacing is decent, moving from Elias's routine to his discovery effectively. However, the character of Elias feels a bit underdeveloped. While his isolation is established, his reaction to the map could be more nuanced. Is he fearful, excited, or something else entirely? The \"tremor\" is a good start, but expanding on his internal response would make him more compelling.\n\nHere are my suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.  **Deepen Elias's Reaction:** Instead of just a \"tremor,\" describe Elias's emotional and physical response more vividly. Does his heart race? Does he feel a sense of awe, dread, or a forgotten longing? Showing his personal connection to this discovery, beyond just finding an object, will make him a more engaging character.\n2.  **Hint at the Map's Origin/Purpose:** While the mystery is key, a subtle clue about *why* this map is there or what it leads to would add intrigue. Is it a warning, an invitation, or a relic? A brief, almost subliminal detail on the map or Elias's immediate intuition could provide this without revealing too much.\n3.  **Consider the \"Otherworldly\" Element:** The description of the map's luminescence is good. To further enhance the \"otherworldly\" aspect, consider how the environment reacts to it, even subtly. Does the sea around the tide pool shimmer differently? Do the gulls fall silent? Small environmental details can amplify the magical or mysterious nature of the discovery.\nRefinerAgent > The salt spray stung Elias's weathered face as he polished the great lens, the rhythmic sweep of the beam his only companion for thirty years, save for the cries of gulls. Tonight, however, the familiar isolation felt charged with an unseen current. A glint on the rocks below, usually swallowed by the tide, snagged his attention.\n\nHe clambered down the treacherous path, the lantern’s swing a nervous counterpoint to his quickening breath. In a tide pool, nestled amongst kelp, lay not a shell, but a parchment, impossibly dry. As Elias unfurled it, intricate lines and symbols pulsed with an otherworldly, blue luminescence, casting an eerie glow on his trembling hands. His heart hammered against his ribs, a frantic drumbeat against the vast silence of the sea. This was no chart of any known ocean. It depicted islands that existed only in whispered legends, connected by paths that shimmered with the same ethereal light. A faint, almost imperceptible hum emanated from the parchment, a song that resonated deep within his bones, a forgotten melody of adventure and peril. He felt a profound sense of awe mixed with a primal fear, as if he had stumbled upon a secret the ocean had guarded for millennia. The very air around the tide pool seemed to thicken, the water’s surface rippling not with the pull of the moon, but with the map’s own arcane energy. The gulls, usually raucous, had fallen silent, their calls seemingly lost to the ancient magic Elias now held. A symbol, like a stylized kraken with glowing eyes, pulsed at the map's center, hinting at a guardian, or perhaps, a destination of unimaginable power. He knew, with a certainty that defied logic, that this was not merely a discovery, but an invitation.\nCriticAgent > APPROVED\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.
